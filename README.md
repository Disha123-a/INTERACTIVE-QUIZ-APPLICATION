DESCRIPTION:

This project is a responsive and interactive quiz application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective of this project is to provide users with a simple, user-friendly interface where they can answer multiple-choice questions and receive instant feedback along with their final score.

The application starts with a name entry screen, where users are required to enter their name before starting the quiz. This feature personalizes the experience, as the final result displays the score along with the user’s name. Once the quiz begins, questions are loaded dynamically, and users can select their answers from the given options.

Each question provides instant feedback after an answer is selected. Correct answers are highlighted in green, while incorrect ones are shown in red, making the interaction clear and engaging. The quiz also includes Back and Next navigation buttons, allowing users to move between questions easily without losing their selected answers.

The application keeps track of the user’s responses and calculates the score automatically. At the end of the quiz, a result screen appears showing the user’s name and total score. There is also a restart option so the quiz can be attempted again.

The interface is designed using modern CSS techniques, including gradients, responsive layouts, and interactive button styles. The layout automatically adjusts for different screen sizes, making the application fully responsive on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
